# Aeon Unreal Plugin

This repository contains an Unreal plugin that simplifies working with the Gameplay Ability System (GAS). It is an extraction of common utilities from several projects. Where each project diverged, this plugin has chosen to adopt a design most closely aligned with the [Lyra Game Sample](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release/Samples/Games/Lyra) under the assumption that this approach is more likely to be familiar with a wider audience.

The plugin is under heavy development, APIs are in flux, and documentation is missing. Don't use it unless you are brave.
