# Modular GAS Enabled Gameplay Actors Unreal Plugin

The plugin defines base gameplay classes that blend the capabilities of the Modular Gameplay plugin and the Gameplay Ability System. The intent is to enable the use of these base classes to quickly initialize new projects.

## Dependencies

The plugin relies on the "ModularGameplayActors" defined as part of the Lyra sample project at [Samples/Games/Lyra/Plugins/ModularGameplayActors](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release/Samples/Games/Lyra/Plugins/ModularGameplayActors). This plugin has been extracted into a separate repository available at https://github.com/realityforge/LyraPlugins for ease of use.
